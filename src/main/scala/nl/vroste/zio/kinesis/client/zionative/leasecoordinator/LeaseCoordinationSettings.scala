/**
 * Settings affecting lease taking, renewing and refreshing
 *
 * Default values are compatible with KCL defaults (TODO not quite yet)
 *
 * @param refreshAndTakeInterval Interval at which leases are refreshed and possibly new leases taken
 * @param renewInterval Interval at which leases are renewed to prevent them expiring
 * @param maxParallelLeaseAcquisitions Maximum parallel calls to DynamoDB to claim a lease.
 *                                     This is not the maximum number of leases to steal in one iteration
 *                                     of `refreshAndTakeInterval`.
 * @param maxParallelLeaseRenewals Maximum parallel calls to DynamoDB to claim a lease.
 *                                     This is not the maximum number of leases to steal in one iteration
 *                                     of `refreshAndTakeInterval`.
 * @param releaseLeaseTimeout Time after which releasing a lease is silently aborted.
 * @param renewRetrySchedule Schedule that controls retries when exceptions occur when renewing a
 *                           lease. The lease is released (internally only) when the schedule fails.
 * @param shardRefreshInterval Interval at which the stream's shards are refreshed
