/**
 * Producer for Kinesis records
 *
 * Supports higher volume producing than making use of the kinesis client directly.
 *
 * Features:
 *   - Batching of records into a single PutRecords calls to Kinesis for reduced IO overhead
 *   - Retry requests with backoff on recoverable errors
 *   - Retry individual records
 *   - Rate limiting to respect shard capacity
 *   - Dynamic throttling: when other systems are producing records, Producer will find a rate that optimizes the
 *     success rate while maintaining high throughput.
 *     - Aggregatting of small records into one Kinesis records.
 *
 * Records are batched for up to 500 records or 5MB of payload size, whichever comes first. The latter two are Kinesis
 * API limits.
 *
 * Individual records which cannot be produced due to Kinesis shard rate limits are retried.
 *
 * Inspired by https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/developing-producers-with-kpl.html and
 * https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/implementing-efficient-and-reliable-producers-with-the-amazon-kinesis-producer-library/
 *
 * Rate limits for the Kinesis PutRecords API (see
 * https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/APIReference/API_PutRecords.html):
 *   - 500 records per request
 *   - Whole request max 5MB
 *   - Each item max 1MB
 *   - Each shard max 1000 records / s
 *   - Each shard max 1MB / s
